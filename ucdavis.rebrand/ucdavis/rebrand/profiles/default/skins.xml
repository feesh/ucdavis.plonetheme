 <!-- A skin-path in this file corresponds to a Skin Selection in the
     'Properties' tab of the portal_skins tool, in the ZMI.
     You can define for each new skin path the layers that it holds. A new
     skin can be based on another existing one by using the 'based-on'
     attribute.
     The definition of a layer accepts these parameters:
       - name: quite self explanatory, the name of the layer.
       - insert-before: name of the layer before which it must be added.
       - insert-after: name of the layer after which it must be added.
       Note: insert-before (and -after) accepts the value "*" which means
       "all".
